In the project, I have used the following libraries:

##### `redux-tool-kit` for state management
##### `react-hook-form` for form validation
##### `react-bootstrap` for UI components and `material-ui/icons` for icons
##### `react-responsive` and `react-bootstrap Grid Layout` for responsive web design
