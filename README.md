# Online Bookstore Project

Demo Link: https://bookstore-react-typescript.vercel.app/

In the project, I have used the following libraries:

##### `redux-tool-kit` for state management
##### `react-hook-form` for form validation
##### `react-bootstrap` for UI components and `material-ui/icons` for icons
##### `react-responsive` and `react-bootstrap Grid Layout` for responsive web design for both desktop and mobile experience

I also create `skeleton loading` for better UX in order of slow internet connection

APIs where I get the data: https://api.itbook.store/
